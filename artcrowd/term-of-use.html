                <h2>ArtCrowd is a Venue and a Service Provider</h2>
                <p>ArtCrowd is an online community crowdfunding platform and acts as a venue to allow members who comply with 
ArtCrowd Policies to raise funds for their projects. ArtCrowd allows individuals, groups and organizations (“Campaign 
Creators”) to list campaigns and raise funds through experiences, donations,  and/or services (“Rewards”) to new and 
existing ArtCrowd members (“Campaign Supporters”). ArtCrowd is not directly involved in the transaction between 
Campaign Creators and Campaign Supporters. ArtCrowd has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any 
aspect of Campaigns or Rewards listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of Campaign Creator to complete 
the Campaign or Rewards, or the ability of a Campaign Supporter to actually pay promised monies. ArtCrowd cannot 
ensure that a Campaign Supporter or a Campaign Creator will actually complete a transaction. Consequently, ArtCrowd 
does not transfer legal ownership of Rewards from the Campaign Supporter to the Campaign Creator. ArtCrowd cannot 
guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a member. ArtCrowd recommend that you check the member’s bio and 
history on the Site for background information and do your own research before providing funds. ArtCrowd is a venue and 
as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, graphics, images, photographs, 
profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other members, or outside parties on ArtCrowd. You agree that use 
of ArtCrowd services is at your own risk.</p>
                
                <h2>Campaigns</h2>
                <p>All funds are collected and managed for the Campaign Creator by Stripe. When a Campaign is created Stripe verifies the 
Campaign Creator and obtains their bank details. Stripe transfers the “Net Funds” due directly to the Campaign Creator. The 
“Net Funds” are the amounts raised during a Campaign less the Stripe Fees and ArtCrowd Fees and are paid to the Campaign 
Creator after the Campaign has completed. ArtCrowd obtain their fee directly from Stripe. ArtCrowd shall not be liable for the 
interactions with any organizations and/or individuals found on or through the ArtCrowd service. All queries regarding funds 
pledged should be referred to the campaign creator at first instance and if the issue is not resolved, then to Stripe. ArtCrowd is 
not involved in the development of Campaigns. It is the responsibility of the Campaign Creator to fulfill the promises of their 
Campaign. ArtCrowd reviews Campaigns to ensure they do not violate ArtCrowd Terms and Conditions, however does not 
investigate a Campaign Creator’s ability to complete their Campaign. ArtCrowd cannot be held liable for the actions of a 
Campaign Creator. Campaign Creators are wholly responsible for fulfilling obligations both implied and stated in any 
Campaign listing they create. ArtCrowd does not oversee the performance or punctuality of Campaigns. ArtCrowd reserves the 
right to remove a Campaign listing from public listings for any reason. All dealings on ArtCrowd are solely between you and 
such individuals and/or organizations. ArtCrowd is not responsible for any damage or loss incurred as a result of any dealings 
on the ArtCrowd platform and is under no obligation to become involved in disputes between Campaign Supporters and 
Campaign Creators, or between site members and any third party. In the event of a dispute, you agree that you release 
ArtCrowd employees, partners and successors in rights from claims, damages and demands of every kind, known or 
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and 
ArtCrowd service. ArtCrowd cannot guarantee the performance or reliability of the Stripe online payment services. ArtCrowd 
cannot guarantee the full receipt of promised funds to a Campaign due to occasional failures when capturing funds from debit 
and credit cards. Campaign Creators and Campaign Supporters agree to be bound by and comply with the Stripe Terms of 
Service <a href="https://stripe.com/us/lega" class="undrline">https://stripe.com/us/lega</a></p>
                <h2>Campaign Rewards and After Sale</h2>
                <p>By listing Campaign Rewards on the Site you warrant that you and all aspects of the Reward comply with the ArtCrowd 
published policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the Reward(s). You must accurately describe your Rewards and 
all terms of sale in your Campaign description and the Reward description. Your listings may only include text descriptions, 
graphics, pictures, videos, photographs and other content relevant to the sale of that Reward. Each Reward must accurately 
and completely describe the item(s) or experience/s on offer. If the “Available” quantity is more than one or unlimited, all items 
and/or experiences listed in that Rewards tier must be identical. Each unique Reward must have its own listing as a new 
Reward. All Campaign Creators are urged to outline terms of sale for their ArtCrowd Campaign. These terms of sale may 
include, for example, shipping, returns, payment and selling terms. Campaign Creators must create reasonable terms in good 
faith and must abide by such terms. All campaign terms must comply with ArtCrowd site-wide policies. Campaign Creators are 
responsible for enforcing their own reasonable campaign terms. ArtCrowd reserves the right to request that a Campaign 
Creator modify their terms and conditions. All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the Reward(s) or otherwise 
complete the transaction with the Campaign Supporter, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the 
Campaign Supporter fails to meet the terms of the Campaign Creator’s listing (such as payment method), or (b) the Campaign 
Creator cannot authenticate the Campaign Supporter’s identity. The Campaign Supporter is obligated to deliver appropriate 
payment for Rewards purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance. ArtCrowd reserves the right to restrict members 
sponsoring ArtCrowd Campaigns or revise the limitations on contributing to ArtCrowd Campaigns, at any time and for any 
reason. ArtCrowd may also further restrict your ability to sponsor Campaigns depending on your country of residence.</p>
