                      <p>ArtCrowd is a crowdfunding platform dedicated exclusively to connecting Fine Artists and Fine Art Organizations with their 
supporters to help them realize their creative potential, build their artistic brand and fund their work. There are many options 
for crowdfunding out there that claim they are for artists, but none understand the particular needs of Fine Art. <strong>ArtCrowd 
understands art because ArtCrowd was designed by artists, art lovers and art professionals for artists, art lovers and 
art professionals.</strong> </p>

                      <p>ArtCrowd will walk you through the steps of building a profile to identify your artistic brand, exhibit your artwork online and 
design a funding campaign to get results. Just follow the 
<strong class="undrline">Step by Step Guide</strong>
. </p>
<p>Your 
<strong>artistic brand</strong>
 is the information and art you use to build your ArtCrowd profile. </p>
 <p>Create a funding 
<strong>Campaign</strong>
 that has a clear cut goal, such as framing a group of paintings for an exhibit, printing an 
exhibition catalogue or building a studio. Choose goals that are realistic and give your patrons a sense of contribution to your 
art. </p>
<p>The 
<strong>funding goal</strong>
 is the amount of money you need to raise to complete objective of the campaign, Funding is all or nothing. 
Your patrons will not be charged if your campaign does not reach its funding goal. So designing
 an attainable objective is 
crucial to success. </p>
<p><strong>Patrons</strong>
 are the generous art lovers who fund your campaign
 to make your art goals a reality. </p>
<p><strong>Rewards</strong>
 are the gifts, Patrons select in recognition of their funding. The best rewards are limited unique experiences and by 
products related to the creative process for which you are seeking funding. Rewards are not intended as a means for selling 
your art, as in an online gallery. Instead offer experiences like a chance to spend a day in your studio, or the chance to go on 
a nature walk with the artist to find sites for landscape paintings, or just meet the artist in a cafe or bar for a beverage. The 
most successful campaigns are the ones that do more than just raise money, they develop relationships with your supporters. </p> 
<p>If you want to get inspired, dive into ArtCrowd and look around. You’re an artist after all, the only limits are your imagination. </p>

when you finalized your campaign and took it live, you are in for a surprise. Like a tree falling in a forest, no one will 
know about your campaign if they don’t know about it... and get reminded. A campaign launched without on-going 
development
, regularly posted updates and even new rewards, will most likely fall short. Share your new content on 
social media, get your friends to share it too. ArtCrowd is designed to provide you with lots of ways to share your 
ArtCrowd activity. So get the word out. And respond too. Your future patrons have questions. Be prepared to answer 
them as soon as possible. Rapid response rate is a key predictor of funding follow through. The longer you take to 
reply, the  more likely your supporters will have moved on.  </p>

<strong>artistic brand</strong> is the information and art you use to build your ArtCrowd profile as an artist or an organization
.</p>
<p>Create a funding 
<strong>Campaign</strong>
 that has a clear cut goal, such as framing a group of paintings for an exhibit, printing an exhibition 
catalogue or building an exhibit space. Choose goals that are realistic and give your patrons a sense of contribution to your art goals. </p>
<p>The 
<strong>funding goal</strong>
 is the amount of money you need to raise to complete objective of the campaign, Funding is all or nothing. Your 
patrons will not be charged if your campaign does not reach its funding goal. So designing
 an attainable objective is crucial to success. </p>
 <p><strong>Patrons</strong>
 are the generous art lovers who fund your campaign
 to make your art goals a reality. </p>
 <p><strong>Rewards</strong>
 are the gifts, Patrons select in recognition of their funding. The best rewards are limited unique experiences and by products 
related to the creative process for which you are seeking funding. Rewards are not intended as a means for selling art, as in an online 
gallery. Instead offer experiences like a chance to spend a day in your studio, or the chance to go on a nature walk with to view sites for 
landscape paintings, or just meet in a cafe or bar for a beverage to talk art. The most successful campaigns are the ones that do more 
than just raise money, they develop relationships with your supporters. </p>
<p>If you want to get inspired, dive into ArtCrowd and look around. You’re an artist after all, the only limits are your imagination. </p>

don’t hear about it... and get reminded... a lot. A campaign launched without on-going development
, regularly posted updates and 
even new rewards, will most likely fall short. Share your new content on social media, get your friends to share it too. ArtCrowd is 
designed to provide you with lots of ways to share your ArtCrowd activity. So get the word out. And respond too. Your future patrons 
have questions. Be prepared to answer them as soon as possible. Rapid response rate is a key predictor of funding follow through.

and not have an all-or-nothing 
goal, the truth is that crowdfunding platforms that work with deadlines and goals significantly outperform 
those that don’t. Your friends and supporters mean well, but without time limits and a focused goal. they will 
procrastinate and forget. It’s human nature. If you’re worried that you might not get your funding, start by 
designing campaigns with modest attainable goals. There is no limit on the number of campaigns you can 
run, but we only allow you to do one at a time. Trust us, you don’t want to multitask task a funding campaign.

                      <p>There are many reasons to become a Patron on ArtCrowd. Before the existence of ArtCrowd, many art lovers 
did not have a transparent or affordable way to support individual artists and individual art organizations’ 
projects. Direct individual involvement was usually reserved only for those who could afford the high price of 
entry. ArtCrowd changes all that by providing a platform for art lovers to become  art Patrons at all levels. 
Becoming a patron of an individual artist, project or organization is a special experience that enriches the life 
of both the creator and the patron. A Patron truly becomes a part of the art they want to see in the world. </p>

                      <p>The secret sauce to succeeding on any crowdfunding platform is networking and promoting, just like in a 
traditional exhibition. If you don’t have a circle of friends online who you can reach by email and social 
media, it will be hard to break out of the pack. Some crowdfunding platforms make a great deal of the 
millions of viewers they have, but they don’t tell you how many of those viewers will actually see your project 
or more importantly, actually support it. “Walk Ins” are rarer than many platforms like to admit.  </p>
						<p>
                        Most meaningful support comes through your connections. Your family and friends get the ball rolling and 
ideally tell their family and friends, The better job you do at outreach, the more likely you will succeed. The 
strength of ArtCrowd is that it turns your network into stakeholders in your creative projects. The most 
convincing evangelizers for art are those who believe enough in it to back their belief with funding. If you 
don’t have a big network, get creative. Use the artist branding tools of ArtCrowd to offer small scale  
campaigns to bring in patrons and build a network. There is no campaign goal minimum amount. There is no 
limit to the number of campaigns you can create. So make some noise and get noticed.

funding from the Campaign they are supporting. Alternately, a Patron can choose to not receive a 
reward for their funding. But either way, patronage ushers an art lover into the world of the artist they

                      <p>Like any investment, Patrons should show due diligence in selecting the artists they support through 
ArtCrowd. Investing in any speculative area is inherently risky. Risk is offset by rewards if the art you 
support succeeds. Look for artists with a track record, whose work is visible elsewhere and who’s 
claims seem credible. Contact the artist and ask them about their experience, their exhibits and all 
relevant information you need to decide if the art deserves your support. Don’t hesitate to contact an 
artist or organization. If they are serious, informed about what they do and respond, chances are they 
will be a good investment.

                    ArtCrowd itself can make no representations about the viability of any artist on it’s site, however, 
ArtCrowd is a very public site and artists here put their reputations on the line. Respect their 
commitment. Understand the risks. Appreciate your roll as a Patron to be an agent of change. Help 
make good art happen

communication. Reach out explain the issues clearly. If you perceive

ask. Two way communication is key. Most people are understanding if they feel they are in the loop.

 <p>Patrons need to appreciate that they are supporting the creation of something new, not

like a pay to play service that charges artists huge fees up front to get their art seen. 
ArtCrowd charges only a slight fee on successful campaigns so we can encourage new
