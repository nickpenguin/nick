into a file specific to you.</p>

                <h2>Our Use of Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use your personal information to facilitate the services you personally request. Your contact information and
bidding history will be passed onto the Auction Companies during the auction sign-up process for them to make

                <h2>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
                <p>While we use your information to provide you with access to our site and services, we also use your information
to contact you regarding our services, offerings, or information you may have requested. We use your
information to improve and personalize our Site so as to make it easier, safer, and quicker to use.</p>
<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communication and other
personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of
example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced under certain circumstances to disclose personal
information to the government or third parties, unaffiliated parties may unlawfully intercept or access
transmissions or private communication, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information collected
from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not
promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communication will always remain
completely private.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>

accuracy, and ensure appropriate use of information, we use industry-leading technical and administrative
practices and procedures that safeguard and secure your information.</p>
